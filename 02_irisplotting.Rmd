```

Our first markdown for EEB workshop

<!-- use html commenting syntax for comments outside the code block that you dont want to have appearing in the final markdown file -->

<!-- let R studio do the comment syntax for you with shift cmd c -->


```{r echo = FALSE}
# echo means the code doesnt display on the final markdown file
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width, xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = 'Sepal Width', main = 'Iris measurements')
```
